I found this Interesting Dataset on Maven Analytics about Space Missions and decided to work on it. The Dataset comes with the Data of Space Missions from 1957 to 2022. It consist of Date, Location, Rocket Name, Rocket Status, Mission Name, Mission Status, and the Company Launch the Mission. ðŸš€

Firstly, I ensure Data quality by meticulously Cleaning and Preparing it for Analysis. Then, I create Pivot Tables to Summarize and Analyze the Data from different angles. Next, I dive into Visualization, leveraging Tools to Transform complex Datasets into Clear, Actionable Insights. After Creating the Visuals, I Delve Deeper to Uncover Valuable Trends and Patterns, Empowering informed Decision-Making Insights. Every step, from Cleaning the Data to Visualization to Extracting Insights, is essential in Unlocking the True Power of Data-Driven Strategies. ðŸ“Š ðŸ“ˆ
